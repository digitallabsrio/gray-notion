  "course_name": "Deep Dive into the Internals of the Database - Learn Interactively",
  "course_overview": "Databases are a type of system for storing data in an organized manner. Understanding the inner workings of databases and knowing about paradigms used in different types of databases is crucial for organizing information. \n\nIn this course, you’ll learn about the fundamental characteristics of databases, how they’re structured internally for efficient distribution, what kind of capabilities are needed to support the distribution model, what features transactions provide, and how they’re implemented.\n\nDifferent kinds of databases—and their structure, architecture, and functionality—will be discussed in depth. You’ll also learn about data structures that work best in certain database models and why they’re chosen over others. After completing this course, you’ll know the basic building blocks and mechanics behind every kind of database management system you might encounter.",
